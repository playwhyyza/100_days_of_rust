        Scalar
            Rust has four primary scalar types:

                2. floating-point number
                3. booleans
                4. characters

        Comparison Table
        Reason	                Explanation
        Hardware                Addressability	CPUs address memory in bytes, not bits
        Performance	            Byte-wise operations are faster than bitwise manipulations
        Language Guarantees	    Rust and C99 guarantee bool is 1 byte for safety and FFI compatibility
        Pointer Semantics	    Cannot take a pointer to a bit; must be at least a byte
        Compiler Optimizations	Unused bits in the byte can be leveraged for enum or Option optimizations

        Array Type 

        another way to collection of multiple values is with an array.
        every element of an array must have the same type.
        array in Rust have a fixed length.

        However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change.

        sample:
            let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

            i32 is the type of each element. after the semicolon
            the 5 indicates the array contains five elements


            let a = [3; 5] 

            the array named a will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially.
            this is the same as writing let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
