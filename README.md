# 100_days_of_rust

It's my challenge!!

This is my hobby.

------------------------------

Hey, It's been ages since I last code this repo must be like 4 or 5 years already.
Alright, I think it's time for a fresh start.
Hoping this time it'll acutally work out.

This time, I'm planning to learn Rust gonna follow this guide: 
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- https://rust-lang.github.io/fls/
- https://yevh.github.io/rust-security-handbook/ [security handbook]

------------------------------

 - https://crates.io/
    - The rust community's crats registry
    - look like pypi.org of python

 - cargo new {project_name}

 - cargo add {denpencies}

 - cargo build
    - when you add new dependencies
    - if haven't anything changed, so Cargo knows it can reuse what it has already downloaded and complied for those.

 - cargo run // execute programe

 - cargo update 
    - when you do want to update a crate

 - cargo doc --open
    - build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and open it in your browser
