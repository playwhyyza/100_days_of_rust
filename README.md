It's my challenge!!

This is my hobby.

------------------------------

Hey, It's been ages since I last code this repo must be like 4 or 5 years already.
Alright, I think it's time for a fresh start.
Hoping this time it'll acutally work out.

This time, I'm planning to learn Rust gonna follow this guide: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ and  https://rust-lang.github.io/fls/
